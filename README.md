# MNIST-using-GAN
Generative adversarial Network is used to generate Mnist like images

Machine learning is a branch of study of that is updated almost daily,and be-
cause of that a new concept is introduced almost everyday.One such concept
is Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN).GAN is an unsupervised deep learn-
ing algorithm where we have a Generator pitted against an adversarial network
called Discriminator. Generative adversarial networks were introduced by 'Ian
Goodfellow et al in 2014'. In this project GAN is used to generate mnist dataset like images.
These images will then be passed for classification to a pre-trained Convolution Neural Network .
